### **Carousel Slide 1 – Context**

**Headline:**
**Women Read the Climate Every Day**

**Subtext:**
Across rural Ghana, women farmers rely on generations of ecological knowledge—cloud movement, wind patterns, plant and animal behavior—to make decisions that sustain families and communities.

---

### **Carousel Slide 2 – The Challenge**

**Headline:**
**But the Climate Has Changed**

**Subtext:**
Climate variability has disrupted familiar patterns. Indigenous forecasting is becoming less predictable, while modern climate tools often exclude women’s realities, languages, and ways of knowing.

---

### **Carousel Slide 3 – The Shift**

**Headline:**
**What If Women Shaped Climate Intelligence?**

**Subtext:**
ObaaSIWA brings women’s knowledge into the center of climate decision-making—combining indigenous indicators with AI through SIWA, the Smart Indigenous Weather App.

---

### **Carousel Slide 4 – The Vision**

**Headline:**
**From Knowledge Holders to Co-Designers**

**Subtext:**
With the right tools, women don’t just receive forecasts. They help decide what data matters, how it is interpreted, and who benefits from it.

# **ABOUT OBAASIWA (Stats + Facts Live Here)**

## **About ObaaSIWA**

**ObaaSIWA** is a women-centered climate intelligence initiative that integrates **indigenous ecological knowledge** with **responsible artificial intelligence** to support better agricultural decision-making.

Built in Ghana, ObaaSIWA recognizes women farmers not as passive users of technology, but as **co-designers and community stewards** of climate data systems.

At the heart of the initiative is [**SIWA**](https://siwa.dipperlab.com), a mobile application that gives farmers access to localized forecasts through the validated indigenous ecological indicators, providing accessible weather insights for their communities.

### **Why It Matters**

Women make critical farming decisions yet are often excluded from climate tools:
* 70% of food production
* 8% land ownership
* <10% credit access
* 30% less likely to own a phone

(elaborate a little bit)

**ObaaSIWA addresses all by design.**

# **EMPOWERMENT (Women + SIWA at the Center)**

## **Empowering Women Through SIWA**

SIWA is more than a weather app.
It is a **shared climate intelligence system**, shaped by the women who use it.

Through SIWA, women farmers:

* Record indigenous ecological indicators in real time
* Compare observations with rainfall data
* Participate in refining how forecasts are generated
* Share feedback on what works in the field

### **From Users to Stewards**

ObaaSIWA intentionally shifts power by enabling women to:

* Lead data collection
* Influence how indicators are interpreted
* Guide feature design and usability
* Serve as community champions and trainers

This approach ensures climate technology supports **equality in practice**, not just in principle.
